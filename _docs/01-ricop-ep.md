# 1. Executive Summary

The Research Infrastructure Community of Practice (CoP) aims to bring
together research infrastructure providers who are, or intend to,
deliver services for sensitive data and its analysis. The CoP provides a
place to bring together shared content that helps the community to
develop and deliver their services.

<div id="introduction" />
# 2. Introduction

This document describes a proposed engagement model to bring together
research infrastructure service providers who have established, or who
are establishing, services to cater for the sharing and analysis of
sensitive data. By establishing a community of practice, it is intended
that participating infrastructure service providers can share their
experiences and leverage the knowledge and experience of others. The
community of practice brings together the collective content and
expertise into one place for all to benefit from when developing and
delivering their services.

<div id="background" />
## 2.1. Background

With an increasing number of researchers seeking to analyse sensitive
data, such as clinical, social, ecological, or commercial data, purpose
built systems are required to ensure that appropriate protections are in
place to safeguard the data. There are a range of criteria that
infrastructure service providers need to meet to successfully deliver
research services suitable for handling and analysing sensitive data.
These criteria encompass a broad spectrum, and include aspects such as
governance, personnel, standards, security, certification, ethics,
trust, authentication, authorisation, and technology. With respect to
providing safe systems for researchers to use for their analysis, it is
believed that better outcomes can be achieved by collaborating and
sharing knowledge and experiences between participating research
infrastructure service providers, rather than by developing systems in
isolation.

<div id="purpose-of-this-document" />
## 2.2. Purpose of this document

This document proposes an approach to bring together research
infrastructure service providers into a community of practice centred on
enabling the secure sharing and analysis of sensitive data.

<div id="audience" />
## 2.3. Audience

The audience for this document are the organisations participating in
the Research Infrastructure CoP, as part of the ARDC funded activity, to
establish a set of Secure eResearch Platform (SeRP) environments to
enable Australian researchers to analyse sensitive data. These
organisations, which will establish the community of practice, are:

-   ARDC

-   Monash University

-   QCIF

-   Curtin University

-   University of Melbourne

-   University of New South Wales - Sydney

-   Sax Institute

The target audience for the outcomes of this engagement plan are
research infrastructure service providers who have established, are
establishing, or intend to establish services to provide researchers and
research communities with the capabilities to securely share and analyse
sensitive data. As at the time of writing this engagement plan,
expressions of interest to participate have been received from TPAC and
The University of Auckland, both of which are part of ARDC’s Nectar
federation.

<div id="overview" />
## 2.4. Overview

The engagement plan describes a set of activities designed to attract
and retain infrastructure service providers who are developing and
delivering services for the analysis of sensitive data. These activities
can be broadly categorised into:

-   Establishing a repository for content and content sharing

-   Soliciting the involvement of like-minded research infrastructure
    service providers

-   Canvassing participating organisations for input, whether that is
    content to be shared or current challenges being faced

-   Organising the periodic gathering of participants to share
    experiences and solutions, potentially focussed on a particular
    aspect common to many participants

Over time, as the community of practice evolves, it may look to develop
a maturity model that describes the capability progression, and
associated criteria, for the delivery of services suited to sensitive
data. Further, this may broaden to examine related capabilities such as
the long term retention and management of sensitive data for research.

<div id="engagement-goals" />
## 2.5. Engagement goals

The Research Infrastructure CoP will accelerate the development and
dissemination of

learnings to support the adoption of the services established through
the deliverables of the project.

The Research Infrastructure CoP working group will empower research
infrastructure teams to deploy, operate, and support platforms for
secure sharing and analysis of sensitive data (including SeRP) with
shared learnings and best practices to build a high quality service,
including certifications, governance, security, and tool integration.

## 3.2. Engagement topics

<div id="infrastructure" />
### 3.2.1 Infrastructure

The infrastructure for the secure sharing and analysis of sensitive data
encompasses hardware, software, networks and the administration of
these. The Research Infrastructure CoP will bring together the best
practices, as well as lessons learnt, in the deployment, management,
operations, and eventual decommissioning of infrastructure.

Key topics to consider initially:

-   Suitability of existing infrastructure for the sharing and analysis
    of sensitive data

-   Is the infrastructure for sensitive data a totally separate
    infrastructure or can research infrastructure providers leverage
    existing investments and operations?

-   What additional infrastructure requirements exist

-   Best practices for infrastructure software deployment and upgrade
    maintenance

### 3.2.2 Security

The security of these environments relies on both infrastructure and
user security, and the management of these. The CoP will share members’
knowledge of identification, evaluation, and recommendation of best
practices to assist with Security and Incident Management.

Key topics include:

-   Physical access security

-   Provision of user access and restrictions

-   Management of patching and upgrades

-   Assessment methods

-   International developments in cybersecurity best practice

-   Security audits and penetration testing

-   Policies and procedures for identified breaches

<div id="tools" />
### 3.2.3 Tools

The organisations represented in the CoP bring a wealth of knowledge and
expertise in the management of their cyber infrastructure. The CoP will
share their knowledge of identification, evaluation, and recommendation
of tools to help with cybersecurity and infrastructure.

Key topic areas include:

-   Tools currently used in Infrastructure management

-   New and emerging tools and techniques, particularly in the security
    > domain

-   Research data planner for data custodian decision support

-   Home-baked tools and hacks

-   Lessons learned

An example of secure data sharing tools available from the CSIRO is:

<div id="risks" />
### 3.2.4 Risks

Protecting sensitive data requires the risks associated with users,
devices, networks, servers, applications and data to be identified and
assessed. Research infrastructure providers play a critical role in
enforcing and controlling all these elements to minimise risk, whilst
enabling researchers to access and analyse sensitive data.

The CoP will bring together the combined expertise in risk
identification and management in the context of the provision of
infrastructure for the sharing and analysis of sensitive data. A stretch
goal is to develop a risk identification and management framework that
can be used by CoP members, to reduce members’ long term effort in this
context. An output of this activity would be a standardised risk
assessment matrix with associated definitions for likelihoods,
consequences, and calculated risk level response strategy.

<div id="regulations-and-requirements" />
### 3.2.5 Regulations and Requirements

There is a range of international, national, state, and organisation
specific cybersecurity standards, policies, and assessment frameworks.
The CoP will provide a forum to discuss the impact of these obligations,
and how research infrastructure providers can navigate and meet such
requirements.

Example requirements include:

-   International

    -   Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

    -   ISO27001

    -   General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

    -   [UK GDPR and the Data Protection Act](https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/guide-to-data-protection)

    -   [IRAP](https://www.cyber.gov.au/acsc/view-all-content/programs/irap)

    -   [Higher Education Community Vendor Assessment Toolkit](https://library.educause.edu/resources/2020/4/higher-education-community-vendor-assessment-toolkit)
        (for high education)

-   National

    -   And many others!

<div id="monitoring-reporting-and-evaluation" />
# 4. Monitoring, Reporting and Evaluation

The CoP will need to establish a Monitoring, Reporting and Evaluation
process that is informed by the requirements of the Management
Committee, the CoP members and their host institutions.

Monitoring can be attained via:

-   CoP Meetings, which can be conducted Bi-Monthly

-   Reviews by the CoP members and Technical Working Group

-   Statistics - A mixture of quantitative and qualitative data capture.

Reporting can be via:

-   Progress reports to Management Committee

-   Progress reports to CoP members in regular meetings

-   Progress reports to hosting institutions

-   Progress reports to funding bodies.

Evaluation can be a powerful tool for decision making and building
support for ongoing funding, and future road maps. The CoP should use
evaluation processes such as those that are widely used in the public
health domain. The CoP will establish the Success Criteria for the CoP’s
engagement activities, which could include:

-   having an established repository for community members

-   the growth of the body of knowledge

-   growth in number of participants

-   uptake of systems for the sharing and analysis of sensitive data.

Key principles:

-   It is a continuous (not just one-off) process informing planning and
    delivery as the project develops;

-   It involves all those with an interest in the project in defining
    the questions they want answered;

-   Allows transparency and accountability to the wider community;

-   It encourages an honest appraisal of progress, so that you can learn
    from what hasn’t worked as well as what has.

-   Find out ‘what works’ and ‘what doesn’t work’

-   Conduct self‐assessment

-   Provide space for group members to self‐reflect

-   Improve capacity

-   Identify new goals

-   Demonstrate effectiveness of CoP

Processes:

-   Questionnaire

-   Reflections

-   Group Assessment

-   Evaluate most significant changes

<div id="governance" />
# 5. Governance

In addition to Monitoring, Reporting, and Evaluation the CoP will need
to establish a governance structure with assigned roles and
responsibilities. Such decisions are beyond the scope of this plan and
should be established during the initial meetings of the members. The
Research Infrastructure CoP Plan provides a foundation on which a
governance structure can be built.
