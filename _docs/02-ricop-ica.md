#  1. Executive Summary

The Research Infrastructure Community of Practice (RICoP) aims to bring
together research infrastructure providers who are, or intend to,
deliver services for sensitive data and its analysis. The CoP provides a
place to bring together shared content that helps the community to
deliver solutions and provide an avenue for knowledge sharing.

<div id="introduction" />
# 2. Introduction

This document describes the minimal required Infrastructure and
Capability Assessment material to safely manage and operate the Secure
eResearch Platform (SeRP). By establishing a clear set of minimum
required capabilities and methods to assess such capabilities, the RICoP
can provide a foundation for knowledge sharing, best practice policies,
governance procedures, and IT infrastructure and technology solutions.

<div id="background" />
## 2.1. Background

With an increasing number of researchers seeking to analyse sensitive
data, such as clinical, social, ecological, or commercial data, purpose
built systems are required to ensure that appropriate protections are in
place to safeguard the data. There are a range of criteria that
infrastructure service providers need to meet to successfully deliver
research services suitable for handling and analysing sensitive data.
These criteria encompass a broad spectrum, and include aspects such as
governance, personnel, standards, security, certification, ethics,
trust, authentication, authorisation, and technology. With respect to
providing safe systems for researchers to use for their analysis, it is
believed that better outcomes can be achieved by collaborating and
sharing knowledge and experiences between participating research
infrastructure service providers, rather than by developing systems in
isolation.

<div id="audience" />
## 2.2. Audience

The audience for this document are the organisations participating in
the Research Infrastructure CoP, as part of the ARDC funded activity, to
establish a set of Infrastructure and Capability Assessment material
suitable for the management and operation of the Secure eResearch
Platform (SeRP) environments to enable Australian researchers to analyse
and share sensitive data. These organisations, which will establish the
community of practice, are:

-   ARDC

-   Monash University

-   QCIF

-   Curtin University

-   University of Melbourne

-   University of New South Wales - Sydney

-   Sax Institute

The target audience for the Infrastructure and Capability Assessment
material are research infrastructure service providers who have
established, are establishing, or intend to establish services to
provide researchers and research communities with the capabilities to
securely share and analyse sensitive data.

<div id="scope" />
## 2.3. Scope

SeRP provides a secure, collaborative environment that allows research
groups to conform to best practises for data management, security and
information governance. The system delivers remote access to a large
scale IT infrastructure together with standard and bespoke analytical
tools. Importantly, it leaves data ownership with the research cohort,
provides devolved account and access controls, enabling cohorts to work
with their own datasets.  
  
ISO27001 requirements provide a standard for establishing, implementing,
maintaining, and continually improving an information security
management system within the context of an organisation. This
International Standard also includes requirements for the assessment and
treatment of information security risks tailored to the needs of the
organisation.  
  
This document will leverage these standards to define required
capabilities needed for operating a SeRP environment with an initial
base level of maturity.

<div id="goals" />
## 2.4. Goals

The aim of creating the Infrastructure and Capability Assessment
material is to establish a clear set of minimum required capability
levels and assessment methods to properly assess such capabilities, the
RICoP can provide a foundation for knowledge sharing, best practice
policies and governance procedures, and IT infrastructure and technology
solutions.

<div id="infrastructure-and-capability-assessment-topics" />
# 3. Infrastructure and Capability Assessment Topics

<div id="cyber-security-risk-management" />
## 3.1 Cyber Security Risk Management

To achieve successful rollout of an environment for the analysis of
sensitive data, a robust risk management framework is required,
particularly for cyber security and information security. This includes
the ability to continuously identify risks, assess risk impacts and
likelihoods, determine appropriate mitigation strategies, and to monitor
for the occurrence of the identified risks and act appropriately. In
addition, risk reporting is an essential element within the governance
framework.

<div id="skills-roles-and-responsibilities1" />
## 3.2 Skills, Roles, and Responsibilities

To achieve successful rollout of SeRP infrastructure and ongoing
management and operations, specific knowledge and skills will be
necessary.  
  
Research Service Providers shall ensure that the responsibilities and
authorities for roles are assigned and communicated.

<div id="information-security1" />
## 3.3 Information Security

The organisation shall plan, implement, and control the processes needed
to meet security requirements and to ensure the protection of
information and its supporting information processing facilities.

The organisation shall perform information security risk assessments at
planned intervals or when significant changes are proposed or occur and
shall retain documented information of the results of the information
security risk assessments.

<div id="data-governance-framework1" />
## 3.4 Data Governance Framework

Data Governance Framework will be the foundation of the policies and
procedures that will systematically identify best practice in all data
activities.  
  
The Data Governance Framework will provide a common language that can be
used across the university and amongst external stakeholders to
effectively communicate about these activities. Whether it is a
strategic review or the building of an IT system, a common language will
be used by everyone â€“ from IT specialists through to lawyers, clinicians
and researchers.

<div id="data-classification-framework1" />
## 3.5 Data Classification Framework

The Data Classification Framework provides a common language that can be
used to describe the different security classes for data. Sensitive data
analysis environments can use this classification framework to specify
which classes of data their environments are tailored for. The data
classification framework enables universities and stakeholders to assess
the suitability of a specific sensitive data analysis environment for
use with their respective data collections.

<div id="support-capabilities1" />
## 3.6 Support Capabilities

The organisation shall determine and provide the resources needed for
the establishment, implementation, maintenance, and continual
improvement of a support capability to service platform end users.  
  
The organisation shall have the capability to prioritise all Support
Requests based on reasonable assessment of the severity level of the
problem reported and respond to all Support Requests in accordance with
the responses and response times specified.

<div id="certifications1" />
## 3.7 Certifications

ISO27001 International Standard specifies the requirements for
establishing, implementing, maintaining, and continually improving an
information security management system within the context of the
organisation. This International Standard also includes requirements for
the assessment and treatment of information security risks tailored to
the needs of the organisation. The requirements set out in this
International Standard are generic and are intended to be applicable to
all organisations, regardless of type, size, or nature. This document
will refine those requirements to allow research service providers to
identify the most important requirements. The degree to which an a
organisation conforms to ISO 27001 is linked to the capability maturity
model, and could be on a scale that looks like:

1.  No certification

2.  No certification, with self-assessment

3.  No certification, with independent third-party assessment

4.  Certification

5.  Certification, with on-going assessment

Other certifications may become in scope for consideration, and linked
to the capability maturity of a system.

<div id="capability-maturity-model" />
## 3.8 Capability maturity model

Whilst currently out of scope, it is envisaged that sensitive data
analysis environments will evolve over time to expand their
capabilities. This maturing in systems capability needs to be able to be
captured, in a cohesive way, as it may influence which data sets are
suitable for use within an environment. Future work for this RICoP will
be to develop a maturity model that can be applied against existing and
developing systems.

<div id=assessment-and-evaluation" />
# 4. Assessment and Evaluation

The following sections outline the assessment and evaluation steps for
Research Infrastructure Service Providers. The following controls will
be provided electronically in an online form to be submitted by the

# 5. Review Process

The Research Infrastructure will evaluate the evidence provided and
provide an assessment and recommendations for the proposed research to
fulfil the requirements to effectively run, manage, and operate a Secure
eResearch Platform.  
  
This will assess the suitability in relation to the above mentioned
topics in relation to the management of the proposed or current
Infrastructure and the ability for support teams at both the
Sub-Licensee and Partner sites to appropriately manage and govern a
secure research environment.
